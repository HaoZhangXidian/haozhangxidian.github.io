		<p>I am now working in Xidian University, as a professor. From 08/01/2020 to 07/31/2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://phs.weill.cornell.edu">Department of Population Health Sciences </a> at 
		   <a style="color: #CC5500;" href="https://weill.cornell.edu">Weill Cornell Medicine</a>, 
		   advised by <a href="https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/index.html">Professor Fei Wang</a>.
		   From 08/01/2019 to 07/31/2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://ece.duke.edu">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering </a>
		 at <a style="color: #CC5500;" href="https://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a>, 
		advised by <a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/">Professor Lawrence Carin</a>.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. from <a href="https://en.xidian.edu.cn">Xidian University</a> in 2012 and 2019, respectively. 
		My Ph.D. advisor was Professor <a href="https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/en/index.html">Bo Chen</a>. 
		I was also advised by Professor <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Mingyuan Zhou</a>, an associate professor from the University of Texas at Austin.
		
		<br>
		<br>My research lies at the intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning. 
		I am interested in statistical methods, hierarchical models, statistical inference for big data, and deep learning. 
		I did some researches about applying machine learning methods on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) analysis when I worked in WCM.
		I currently focus on advancing both statistical inference with deep learning, deep learning with probabilistic methods and 
		their applications to natural language processing, multi-modal learning, and radar signal processing.
